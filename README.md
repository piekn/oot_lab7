This is a demo of the Memento Pattern, implemented in JavaScript. The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to save its internal state without exposing its implementation to the client, and restore its state later.

In this demo, the Memento Pattern is used to implement an undo-redo functionality for an increment operation on an integer value. The code defines three classes:

    Originator: This is the object whose state needs to be saved and restored. In this case, it is a simple object with a single integer property 'state', which is incremented on each call to the 'increment' method.

    Memento: This is a class that stores the state of the Originator object. It has a single property 'state', which is set to the state of the Originator object when it is created.

    Caretaker: This is the class that manages the Memento objects. It has an instance of the Originator object, and an array of Memento objects. Whenever the 'increment' method is called on the Originator object, the Caretaker object creates a new Memento object and adds it to the array. The 'undo' and 'redo' methods of the Caretaker class retrieve the Memento objects from the array and use them to restore the state of the Originator object.

The HTML code defines a simple web page with three buttons to call the 'increment', 'undo', and 'redo' methods of the Caretaker object, and a span element to display the current state of the Originator object.

When the user clicks the 'Increment' button, the 'increment' method of the Caretaker object is called, which in turn calls the 'increment' method of the Originator object, and saves the state of the Originator object using the 'saveState' method. The current state of the Originator object is then displayed on the web page.

When the user clicks the 'Undo' button, the 'undo' method of the Caretaker object is called, which retrieves the last saved state of the Originator object from the array of Memento objects, and restores the state of the Originator object using the 'restoreState' method. The current state of the Originator object is then displayed on the web page.

When the user clicks the 'Redo' button, the 'redo' method of the Caretaker object is called, which retrieves the next saved state of the Originator object from the array of Memento objects, and restores the state of the Originator object using the 'restoreState' method. The current state of the Originator object is then displayed on the web page.

let me explain how the Memento pattern works in this example in more detail:

    The Originator class represents the object whose state needs to be saved and restored. In this example, the Originator class has a single property called state, which represents an integer value. The Originator class also has methods to change its state (increment) and to get/set its state (getState and setState). When the state of the Originator object changes, the object creates a Memento object to save its current state.

    The Memento class represents the snapshot of the Originator's state that needs to be saved. In this example, the Memento class has a single property called state, which stores the state of the Originator object when the Memento object is created.

    The Caretaker class is responsible for managing the Memento objects and the state of the Originator object. The Caretaker class has an instance of the Originator object and an array to store Memento objects. Whenever the Originator's state changes, the Caretaker creates a new Memento object to save the current state of the Originator and adds it to the array of Memento objects. The Caretaker class also has methods to restore the Originator's state to a previous state (undo) or to a later state (redo).

    The Client code is responsible for using the Originator and Caretaker objects to achieve the desired behavior. In this example, the Client code is a simple HTML web page with three buttons to call the methods of the Caretaker object. The Client code calls the increment method of the Caretaker object when the user clicks the "Increment" button. This method calls the increment method of the Originator object to change its state and creates a new Memento object to save the current state of the Originator. The Client code calls the undo method of the Caretaker object when the user clicks the "Undo" button. This method retrieves the last Memento object from the array of Mementos, restores the state of the Originator object to the state saved in the Memento object, and updates the display to show the current state of the Originator. The Client code calls the redo method of the Caretaker object when the user clicks the "Redo" button. This method retrieves the next Memento object from the array of Mementos, restores the state of the Originator object to the state saved in the Memento object, and updates the display to show the current state of the Originator.

The Memento pattern allows the Originator object to save and restore its state without violating encapsulation, because the Memento object is only accessible by the Originator object and the Caretaker object. This pattern is useful when you need to provide an undo-redo functionality or a history of changes for an object's state.
